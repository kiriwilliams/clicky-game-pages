# Pokemon Memory Game
How well do you know your starter pokemon? Your goal is to click each starter pokemon exactly once, but watch out! They shuffle each time you click!

## How it Works
The game uses React states to track which images have been already been clicked in a game. Once an image has been clicked, it changes its state and shuffles the board. If a user clicks the same image twice, it's game over.
