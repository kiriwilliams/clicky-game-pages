# Pokemon Memory Game
How well do you know your starter pokemon? Your goal is to click each starter pokemon exactly once, but watch out! They shuffle each time you click!

### How does it work?
The game is built using react, and keeps track of which pokemon have been clicked in the state. After each click it calls the shuffle function, which reorders the pokemon randomly.
